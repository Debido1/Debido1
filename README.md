  # Hi 👋, I'm Deborah Enehi Apochi

👩‍💻 Data Analyst | E-commerce & Agri-tech Enthusiast

🔍 I specialize in E-commerce and Agri-tech data analysis, helping businesses uncover insights to drive growth, efficiency, and sustainability.

📊 My expertise includes:

Analyzing customer behavior and sales performance in e-commerce

Evaluating market trends and pricing strategies

Leveraging data for crop sales prediction, yield performance, and agri-supply chain optimization

Building interactive dashboards with Power BI & Excel

Using SQL for database querying and Python (pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn) for analysis & visualization


💡 I’m passionate about using data to answer critical business questions, such as:

Which products or crops generate the most revenue/profit?

How can businesses optimize sales channels and reduce costs?

What trends can help forecast demand and improve decision-making?


🎵 Outside of data, I enjoy listening to music, watching movies, and catching up with friends.
